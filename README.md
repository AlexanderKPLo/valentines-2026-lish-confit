Welcome to my portfolio! This project is a documentation of a **Blue Ribbon-style** cooking experiment, blended with the unique linguistic style of **Lish**.

## 📖 Project Overview

- **Tech Stack:** Git for documentation, Google Gemini for visual conceptualization.
- **Vibe:** Classy, slow-cooked, and very "chill."
