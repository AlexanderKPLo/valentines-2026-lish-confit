---

## 📖 Introduction
This project is more than just a recipe; it is a documented **Experience Design** combining classical French culinary techniques with modern digital storytelling. 

Centered around a **Blue Ribbon-style Confit Pork Belly**, this portfolio showcases the fusion of traditional craftsmanship and technical documentation, narrated in the unique, cross-cultural linguistic style of **Lish (Cantonese-English hybrid)**.

## 🚀 Project Highlights
* **Concept:** A "Low & Slow" approach to both cooking and lifestyle, celebrating a Valentine’s Day and Lunar New Year reunion in the UK.
* **Technical Stack:** * **Frontend:** Responsive UI with AOS (Animate on Scroll) for a cinematic feel.
    * **Backend:** PHP-based RSVP system with JSON persistence (UK Corporate Standard).
    * **AI Collaboration:** Visual conceptualization and asset generation via Google Gemini.
* **Vibe:** Classy, meticulously planned, and "Target" (Authentic).

## 💻 Backend Logic (PHP)
> **Note:** Since GitHub Pages is a static hosting service, the `submit.php` script is archived for demonstration purposes only.

This project features a custom PHP backend to handle RSVP data. It includes:
* **Security:** Passcode validation (`demo0214`) to prevent unauthorized entries.
* **Data Management:** Auto-saving to a `dishes.json` flat-file database.
* **Integrity:** Input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks.

// See submit.php for the full annotated source code.
// The logic handles everything from UK timezones to data locking.
