# 🌹 Blue Ribbon Confit Pork Belly (Valentine 2026)

Welcome to my portfolio! This project is a documentation of a **Blue Ribbon-style** cooking experiment, blended with the unique linguistic style of **Lish**.

## 📖 Project Overview
- **Objective:** Recreating the classic French Confit technique for a Valentine's vibe.
- **Tech Stack:** Git for documentation, Google Gemini for visual conceptualization.
- **Vibe:** Classy, slow-cooked, and very "chill."

## 💻 Backend Logic (PHP)
> **Note:** Since GitHub Pages is a static hosting service, the `submit.php` script is archived for demonstration purposes only.

This project features a custom PHP backend to handle RSVP data. It includes:
* **Security:** Passcode validation (`demo0214`) to prevent unauthorized entries.
* **Data Management:** Auto-saving to a `dishes.json` flat-file database.
* **Integrity:** Input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks.

\`\`\`php
// See submit.php for the full annotated source code.
// The logic handles everything from UK timezones to data locking.
